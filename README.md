Hi Im Brendan i made this "virus" in my free time blah blah blah
Extract the file
if this comes up on windows defender or any other antivirus: TrojanWin32/Azden.A!cl
click let run or its safe or what ever this 1ggFF.exe is the one that is being detected (if you dont beleve that it doesent hurt your pc make it a bat file and see the code i put in it. HARMLESS!)
then (if you want) open MainVirus(in .bat form).bat
it does no real harm to your pc
but might freek out you and your friends
Have Fun (you can edit my code if you want to make a real trojen horse)
this has a smallll chance to "harm"(or just lag) your pc. but once you close it your fine. if your still lagging restart your pc.
